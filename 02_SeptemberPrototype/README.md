# September Prototype #

Starting out, I know I want to make a game based on cards or a similar set of symbols placed on a board, which the player then moves, rotates or similar to clear space on the board and progress. Inpiration from games like MineSweeper, 3-in-a-row games. A simple puzzler with a focus on flow state.

## Figuring out the mechanics ##
Test mechanics with analog materials or code and iterate?
